    - Web focused!
    - Great community

    - Focused on industry needs (ruby is intro)
    - Game focused (it is web focused)
what the wagon teaches
    - front
    - back
what the wagon doesn't teach
    - scripting languages
    - Industry roadmap
    - Tech depth
    - static programming (java, csharp)

---------------------------

How wagon games would work on weaknesses, at low costs
    - real life experience

How wagon games could get attention to the wagon (good publicity)
    - some exercises are already games (see sinatra)

Enroll to a program, after the bootcamp
    - one week of wagon games...

Taught in english and french
Very accessible learning curve (ruby is lua)
OOP


No expenses for the Wagon, but something to advertise

Enroll on wagon games program.
On campus.

---------------------------

Why?
    - because montreal is the world capital of video games
    - because its better for their portfolios
    - it increases their chances of being seen
    - its has huge benefits for the amount of effort (lua is easier than ruby!)

    --- see comparaison





What?
    - take student's portfolio a step further, by working on a new project, in a new language (no learning curve!)
    - at the end of the week, the batch uploads their game on the wagon game website page. 
    - everybody can play the game of other batches
    - everybody gets a real coding contribution in a scripting languages
    - the batch can construct a real prototype and pitch it to wagon partners!! Including ubisoft. and indie game developers.
    - coding is about more than the web.
